== `Smsdid`: Supervisor Domain Identifier and Protection Register

`Smsdid` defines an interface to program the active supervisor domain
under which a hart is operating. The interface consists of M-mode CSRs `msdcfg`
and `mmpt`. The SDID programmed via this interface is a local identifier for the
hart and may be used to tag hart-local resources to access-control data
associated with the supervisor domain. The SDID is
unique only to a hart, hence, SDID must not be used to tag downstream
transactions that are globally visible.

[NOTE]
====
For most typical usages, the SDID will remain stable over the life
of the supervisor domain. However, the SDID can be changed
at the cost of flushing any prior cached state that was
associated with the SDID.

=== Machine-level Memory Protection Tables (`mmpt`)

The `mmpt` register is an `XLEN`-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in
<<sdid-32>> for `XLEN=32` and <<sdid-64>> for `XLEN=64`, which controls
physical address protection for supervisor domains. This register holds the
physical page number (`PPN`) of the root page of the memory protection tables
(`MPT`), a supervisor domain identifier (`SDID`), which facilitates address
protection fences on a per-supervisor-domain basis; and the `MODE` field, which
selects the address protection scheme (MPT Mode to be enforced) for physical
addresses. The MPT is a structure that holds the access permissions for a
physical address and is looked up per the programmed `MODE`.

Attempts to read or write `mmpt` while executing in U or S-mode will raise
an illegal instruction exception.

<<mpt-32>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=32` and
<<mpt-64>> shows the encodings of the `MODE` field when `XLEN=64`. When `mmpt`
`MODE=Bare`, supervisor physical addresses have no MPT-based protection across
supervisor domains beyond the physical memory protection scheme described in
Section 3.7 of the RISC-V privileged architecture specification cite:[ISA]. In
this case, the remaining fields (`SDID`, `PPN`) in `mmpt` must be set to
zeros. When `XLEN=32`, the other valid setting for `MODE` is `2_level` to
support read-write-execute access permissions for 34-bit system physical
addresses.

When `XLEN=64`, other than `BARE`, the other valid settings for `MODE` are
`3_level`, `4_level` and `5_level` to support read-write-execute permissions for
43-bit (3 level `MPT`), 52-bit (4-level `MPT`) and 64-bit (5-level `MPT`) system
physical addresses.

The remaining `MODE` settings when `XLEN=64` are `reserved` for future use and
may define different interpretations of the other fields in `mmpt`.

Implementations are not required to support all defined `MODE` settings when
`XLEN=64`. A write to `mmpt` with an unsupported `MODE` value is not ignored.
Instead, the fields of `mmpt` are `WARL` in the normal way, when so indicated
in <<sdid-32>> and <<sdid-64>>.

`mmpt.PPN` refers to an `MPTL5`, `MPTL4`, `MPTL3` or `MPTL2` table based on
`MODE`. The top-level MPT may be smaller than the size given in <<Smmpt-rw>> for
that table level, provided that it contains enough entries to cover the
platform's physical address width (`PAW`), which is the number of bits needed to
express the platform-defined maximum-addressable physical address.

For `PAW` = 64, a top-level `MPTL5` table must be complete; for 64 > `PAW` >= 52
the `MPTL5` table must contain at least `2^(PAW-52)` entries, otherwise it must
contain at least one entry; for 52 > `PAW` >= 43 the `MPTL4` table must contain
at least `2^(PAW-43)` entries; otherwise it must contain at least one entry. For
43 > `PAW` >= 34 (34 for XLEN=32 MODE=`2-level`) the `MPTL3` table must contain
at least `2^(PAW-34)`. For `PAW` = 34, a top-level `MTTL2` table must be
complete; otherwise for 34 > `PAW` >= 25 the table must contain at least
`2^(PAW-25)` entries; otherwise it must contain at least one entry. The
top-level table must be naturally aligned to its size, or aligned to a 4 KiB
page boundary, whichever is greater.

The number of `SDID` bits is `UNSPECIFIED` and may be zero. The number of
implemented `SDID` bits, termed `SDIDLEN`, may be determined by writing one to
every bit position in the `SDID` field, then reading back the value in `mmpt`
to see which bit positions in the `SDID` field hold a one. The
least-significant bits of `SDID` are implemented first: that is, if `SDIDLEN` >
0, `SDID`[`SDIDLEN`-1:0] is writable. The maximal value of `SDIDLEN`, termed
`SDIDMAX`, is 6 for all `Smmpt` modes.

The `mmpt` register is considered active for the purposes of the physical
address protection algorithm unless the effective privilege mode is `M`.

Note that writing `mmpt` does not imply any ordering constraints between
`S-mode` and `G-stage` page-table updates and subsequent address translations.
If a supervisor domain's `MPT` structure has been modified, or if a `SDID` is
reused, it may be necessary to execute a `MFENCE.SPA` instruction before or
after writing `mmpt`.

=== Machine supervisor domain configuration (`msdcfg`)

The `msdcfg` is a 32-bit read/write register, formatted as shown in <<MSDCFG>>.
This CSR is used by M-mode software to specify the active configuration for
capabilities of the supervisor domain when associated with a hart. +
The following extensions use the `msdcfg` register to specify additional
configuration for supervisor domains:

. `Smsdia` uses `msdcfg.SDICN` to specify the active configuration for
  the supervisor domain interrupt controller associated with the hart.
. `Smsdedbg` specifies the `msdcfg.sdedbgalw` bit to manage
  external-debug for a supervisor domain.
. `Smsdetrc` specifies the `msdcfg.sdetrcalw` bit to manage
  external-trace for a supervisor domain.
. `Smqosid` specifies the control bits `SSM`, `SRL`, `SML` and `SQRID` to enable
  the RDSM to manage QoS controls for supervisor domains.

Details of `Smsdia`, `Smsdedbg`, `Smsdetrc` and `Smqosid` are described in their
respective sections in this specification.

=== M-mode Supervisor Domain Fence Instruction


[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title="MFENCE.SPA instruction"]
[id=mfence-spa]
[wavedrom, ,svg]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MFENCE.SPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `MFENCE.SPA` fence instruction is used to synchronize updates to supervisor
domain access-permissions with current execution.
`MFENCE.SPA` is only valid in M-mode. If operand rs1≠x0, it
specifies a single physical address, and if rs2≠x0, it specifies a single SDID.

If the address in rs1 corresponds to an `MPT_LEAF` entry mapping, the fence
applies to a 4 KiB page. If the address in rs1 corresponds to a
`MPT_LEAF_NAPOT_L1` mapping, the fence applies to a 2 MiB (XLEN=64) or 4 MiB
(XLEN=32) range. If the address in rs1 corresponds to a `MPT_LEAF_NAPOT_L2`
mapping, the fence applies to a 1 GiB range.

The behavior of `MFENCE.SPA` depends on rs1 and rs2 as follows:

* If rs1=x0 and rs2=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes to the MPT for
all supervisor domain address spaces.
* If rs1=x0 and rs2≠x0, the fence orders all reads and writes to the MPT for
the supervisor domain address space identified by the SDID in rs2.
* If rs1≠x0 and rs2=x0, the fence orders all reads and writes made to the MPT
that correspond to the physical address in rs1, for all supervisor domain
address spaces.
* If rs1≠x0 and rs2≠x0, the fence orders all reads and writes made to the MPT
that correspond to the physical address in rs1, for the supervisor domain
address space identified by the SDID in rs2.

Executing a `MFENCE.SPA` guarantees that any previous stores
already visible to the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by
that hart done for supervisor domain access-permission structures for
non-M-mode instructions that follow the `MFENCE.SPA`.

When SDID is specified in rs2, bits XLEN-1:SDIDMAX held in rs2 are reserved for
future standard use. Until their use is specified, they should be zeroed by
software and ignored by implementations. Also, if SDIDLEN < SDIDMAX, the
implementation shall ignore bits SDIDMAX-1:SDIDLEN of the value held in rs2.

[NOTE]
====
A simpler implementation of MFENCE.SPA may ignore the physical address in rs1,
and/or the SDID value in rs2, and always perform a global fence for all SDs.
====

=== M-mode Supervisor Domain Fine-Grain Invalidation Instruction

In some high-performance implementations, a finer-granular invalidation and
fencing is required that allows for synchronization operations to be more
efficiently batched. When `Svinval` is implemented with `Smsdid`, the
`MINVAL.SPA` instruction must be implemented to support such fine-granular
invalidation of physical memory access-permission caches.

[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title="MINVAL.SPA instruction"]
[id=minval-spa]
[wavedrom, ,svg]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  7, name: 'opcode (SYSTEM)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rd (0)'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'func3 (PRIV)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs1 (PADDR)'},
  {bits:  5, name: 'rs2 (SDID)'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'func7 (MINVAL.SPA)'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

`MINVAL.SPA` is only ordered against `SFENCE.W.INVAL` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR`
instructions. As part of the update to the SD access-permissions, the RDSM must
ensure that it uses `SFENCE.W.INVAL` to guarantee that any previous stores to
structures that hold supervisor domain access-permissions (e.g. `MPT`) are made
visible before invoking the `MINVAL.SPA`. The RDSM must then use
`SFENCE.INVAL.IR` to guarantee that all subsequent implicit references to
supervisor domain access-permission structures (e.g. `MPT`) are ordered to be
after the SD access-permissions cache invalidation. When executed in order (but
not necessarily consecutively) by a single hart, the sequence `SFENCE.W.INVAL`,
`MINVAL.SPA` and `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` has the same effect as a hypothetical
`MFENCE.SPA` in which:

* the values of rs1 and rs2 for the `MFENCE.SPA` are the same as those used in
the `MINVAL.SPA`,
* reads and writes prior to the `SFENCE.W.INVAL` are considered to be those
prior to the `MINVAL.SPA`, and
* reads and writes following the `SFENCE.INVAL.IR` are considered to be those
subsequent to the `MFENCE.SPA`

`MINVAL.SPA` is only valid in M-mode.

=== Extension to behavior of SFENCE.VMA, HFENCE.GVMA and HFENCE.VVMA

The behavior of the SFENCE.VMA, HFENCE.GVMA and HFENCE.VVMA instructions are
affected when the Smsdid extension is implemented.

When SFENCE.VMA is used within a supervisor domain, the virtual-address argument
is a virtual address with either the ASID being a S/HS-level ASID (V=0), or a
VS-level ASID (V=1).

For S/HS-level ASID, the virtual-address argument to SFENCE.VMA is a host
virtual address within the current supervisor domain, and the ASID argument is
a S/HS-level ASID within the current supervisor domain. The current supervisor
domain is identified by the SDID field of the CSR mmpt, and the effective ASID
can be considered the combination of the SDID and the S/HS-level ASID. The
SFENCE.VMA orders stores only to this S/HS-level address-translation structures
with subsequent S/HS-level address translations.

When V=1, the virtual-address argument to SFENCE.VMA is a guest virtual address
within the current virtual machine, and the ASID argument is a VS-level ASID
within the current virtual machine. The current virtual machine is identified by
the SDID field of the CSR mmpt and the VMID field of CSR hgatp. The effective
ASID within this virtual machine can be considered to be the combination of this
SDID and VMID along with the VS-level ASID. The SFENCE.VMA instruction orders
stores only to the VS-level address-translation structures with subsequent
VS-stage address translations for the same virtual machine, i.e., only when
mmpt.SDID and the hgatp.VMID is the same as when the SFENCE.VMA executed.

For HFENCE.GVMA, the guest-physical address argument is within the context of
the current virtual machine idenfied by the combination of the SDID field of the
CSR mmpt and the VMID field of CSR hgatp. Executing an HFENCE.GVMA guarantees
that any previous stores already visible to the current hart are ordered before
all implicit reads by that hart done for G-stage address translation for
instructions that follow the HFENCE.GVMA, and execute with the same mmpt.SDID
and hgatp.VMID when HFENCE.GVMA executed.

For HFENCE.VVMA, the guest-virtual address argument is within the context of
the current virtual machine identified by the combination of the ASID specified
in the vsatp, the VMID field of CSR hgatp, and the SDID field of CSR mmpt.
Executing an HFENCE.VVMA guarantees that any previous stores already visible to
the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by that hart done for
VS-stage address translations for instructions that are subsequent to the
HFENCE.VMMA and execute when hgatp.VMID and mmpt.SDID have the same setting as
it did when HFENCE.VVMA executed.

=== Extension to behavior of `Svinval`

When `Svinval` is implemented with `Smsdid` the behavior of SINVAL.VMA is
modified to also use the SDID from the CSR mmpt in addition to the ASID provided
in SINVAL.VMA.

When the `Hypervisor` extension is also implemented, the behavior of HINVAL.VVMA
and HINVAL.GVMA is modified to also use the SDID from the CSR mmpt in addition
to the VMID provided in the HINVAL.GVMA or the ASID provided in HINVAL.VVMA.
